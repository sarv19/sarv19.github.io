            <p>
            I'm a full-stack engineer, currently doing my master's degree.
            I love turning coffee into code and making digital things work smoothly.
            I enjoy creating websites where everything just clicks, from how it looks to how it runs.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not deep into coding, you'll find me watching movies, playing guitar,
                and getting lost in food travel videos.
                These hobbies keep me relaxed and bring a bit of fun to my tech-filled world.
